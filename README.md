# Micronet

A minimal networking protocal for the microbit

# Installation

## Online compiler

The library hosted through Mbed can be found [here](https://os.mbed.com/users/scotch101tape/code/micronet/). The project using the library must also have [microbit](https://os.mbed.com/teams/Lancaster-University/code/microbit/) (the microbit library) imported. These can be easily added to the online compiler through the import function.
